#### ✅ **Areas for Simplification or Optimization**

1. **Batch Block Fetching**
   - [x] **Current:** Fetches blocks one-by-one in a loop (`GetBlocks` calls `GetBlock` repeatedly).
   - [x] **Suggestion:** If the chain supports batch RPC (e.g., EVM with `eth_getBlockByNumber` batch), implement true batch fetching to reduce RPC roundtrips and improve throughput.

2. **Error Handling & Retries**
   - [x] **Current:** Retries are per-request, but a single block fetch failure aborts the whole batch.
   - [x] **Suggestion:** On batch errors, consider skipping only the failed block(s) and continuing with others, or retrying only failed blocks. Optionally, add exponential backoff for repeated failures.

3. **Worker State Persistence**
   - [x] **Current:** `currentBlock` is in-memory; on restart, progress may be lost.
   - [ ] **Suggestion:** Persist `currentBlock` to disk or a database (or use the storage backend) to resume accurately after restarts/crashes.

4. **Config/Flag Handling**
   - [x] **Current:** Some CLI flags and config are duplicated or not fully unified.
   - [ ] **Suggestion:** Unify CLI and config loading, and allow CLI flags to override config values for flexibility.

5. **Event Emission**
   - [x] **Current:** Emits all transactions and blocks as events.
   - [ ] **Suggestion:** Consider filtering or deduplicating events if needed, or supporting event hooks/plugins for custom processing.

6. **Code Duplication**
   - [x] **Current:** EVM and Tron indexers have very similar logic.
   - [ ] **Suggestion:** Abstract common logic (e.g., block/tx parsing, batch fetching) into shared helpers or base structs to reduce duplication.

7. **Testing**
   - [x] **Current:** Good test coverage for rate limiter, but unclear for indexer logic.
   - [ ] **Suggestion:** Add integration tests for the full indexer flow, including event emission and error handling.

8. **Observability**
   - [x] **Current:** Logs and NATS events are present.
   - [ ] **Suggestion:** Add metrics (e.g., Prometheus) for processed blocks, errors, and RPC stats for better monitoring.
